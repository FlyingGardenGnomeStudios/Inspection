# Inspection
Create inspection reports directly within Inventor
This is a work in progress which will hopefully become an add-in for Inventor.

The add in will enable the user to create 1st order inspection drawings that will remain concurrent with the drawing through its revisions.
The table and values will populate automatically from the information stored in the drawing/model.
